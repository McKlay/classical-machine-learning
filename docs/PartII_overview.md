# **Part II – Core Algorithms (Supervised Learning)**

> *"The foundation of machine learning mastery lies in understanding the algorithms that transform data into decisions."*

## **Building Your Algorithmic Toolkit**

With the foundations of machine learning and scikit-learn established, we now turn to the heart of supervised learning: the algorithms that power prediction and classification. This part introduces you to the essential supervised learning methods, from simple baselines to sophisticated ensemble techniques.

You'll progress from understanding the mathematical intuition behind each algorithm to implementing them effectively with scikit-learn, learning not just how they work, but when and why to choose one over another.

## **Why This Part Matters**

Supervised learning algorithms form the backbone of most machine learning applications. Understanding these core methods deeply – their assumptions, strengths, limitations, and implementation details – is essential for becoming a proficient machine learning practitioner.

Each chapter builds your intuition through mathematical development, then grounds that understanding in practical scikit-learn implementation. You'll learn not just to apply these algorithms, but to diagnose their behavior, tune their parameters effectively, and select the right tool for each problem.

By the end of Part II, you'll have a comprehensive toolkit of supervised learning methods, ready to tackle real-world prediction and classification challenges with confidence and understanding.
