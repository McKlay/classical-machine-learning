# **Part III – Model Evaluation & Tuning**

> *"A model is only as good as its ability to be measured and improved—evaluation and tuning turn potential into performance."*

---

## **From Training to Trustworthy Models**

You've learned the core algorithms and how they work. Now comes the critical phase where you transform trained models into reliable, high-performance systems.

But here's where many practitioners stumble:
- Models that look great on paper fail in the real world
- Default hyperparameters lead to suboptimal performance
- Uncalibrated probabilities make decision-making unreliable
- One-size-fits-all thresholds ignore business costs

Part III bridges the gap between model training and production-ready systems.

This section teaches you how to **evaluate**, **calibrate**, and **optimize** your models so they perform reliably across different scenarios and deliver real business value.

## **What You’ll Master in This Part**

- Comprehensive evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy
- Robust cross-validation techniques for reliable performance estimation
- Systematic hyperparameter tuning strategies
- Probability calibration for trustworthy uncertainty estimates
- Cost-sensitive threshold selection for business-aligned decisions

## **Why This Part Matters**

You can train a thousand models, but without proper evaluation and tuning, you'll never know which one to trust.

This part will help you:

- Choose the right metrics for your specific problem (not just accuracy)
- Avoid overfitting through proper cross-validation
- Systematically improve model performance through hyperparameter optimization
- Generate reliable probability estimates for decision-making
- Align model predictions with real-world business costs and constraints

> When it's time to deploy, you'll be able to say:  
> *"This model doesn't just work—it works reliably, efficiently, and aligned with our objectives."*
