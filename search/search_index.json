You provide examples where both the input (features) and the correct output (target) are known. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so it can predict on new, unseen data. Examples include predicting house prices (regression) or classifying emails as spam (classification).</p> <p>Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data. There are no correct answers provided; the algorithm must find patterns or structure on its own. Common tasks include grouping similar data points (clustering) or reducing data dimensions for visualization.</p> <p>Supervised learning is like learning with a teacher who provides answers, while unsupervised learning is exploring without guidance.</p> <p>Types of Models (Classification, Regression, Clustering) ML models fall into categories based on the type of problem they solve:</p> <ul> <li>Classification: Predicts discrete categories. For example, determining if a tumor is benign or malignant (binary classification) or classifying handwritten digits (multi-class classification).</li> <li>Regression: Predicts continuous values. Like estimating a house's price based on features such as size and location.</li> <li>Clustering: Groups data points into clusters based on similarity. Useful for customer segmentation or anomaly detection.</li> </ul> <p>These are the building blocks; most classical ML algorithms fit into one or more of these categories.</p> <p>Typical ML Pipeline A standard machine learning pipeline follows these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Data Collection: Gather relevant data from sources like databases, APIs, or sensors.</li> <li>Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.</li> <li>Feature Engineering: Select or create features that best represent the problem.</li> <li>Model Selection and Training: Choose an algorithm, split data into train/validation/test sets, and train the model.</li> <li>Model Evaluation: Assess performance using metrics like accuracy or RMSE, and tune hyperparameters.</li> <li>Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy the model in production and monitor its performance over time.</li> </ol> <p>This pipeline is iterative; you may loop back to earlier steps as you refine your approach.</p> <p>Role of scikit-learn Scikit-learn is the most popular library for classical machine learning in Python. It provides a consistent API for over 40 algorithms, including everything from linear regression to random forests. Its design emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and integration with the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib).</p> <p>Scikit-learn handles the heavy lifting of implementation, allowing you to focus on the concepts and applications.

While K-means assumes spherical clusters around centroids, DBSCAN discovers the organic shapes that exist in real-world data.</p> <p>This method teaches us that not all data points need to belong to clusters. Some points are simply noise\u2014outliers that don't fit any pattern. This honesty about uncertainty is powerful in practical applications where forcing every point into a cluster can lead to misleading results.</p> <p>As you build clustering systems, remember that DBSCAN excels when you want to discover natural groupings rather than impose them. It's particularly valuable in exploratory data analysis, where you want to understand what patterns actually exist rather than what you expect to find.</p> <p>Mastering density-based clustering adds sophistication to your analytical toolkit, enabling you to find meaningful patterns in noisy, irregular data that other methods would miss.</p>"},{"location":"chapter14/","title":"Chapter 11: Model Evaluation Metrics","text":"<p>\"The map is not the territory, but metrics are our compass in the landscape of model performance.\"</p>"},{"location":"chapter14/#learning-objectives","title":"Learning Objectives","text":"<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Understand the purpose and limitations of common evaluation metrics for classification models</li> <li>Compute and interpret accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix</li> <li>Generate and analyze Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves</li> <li>Identify situations where different metrics provide conflicting information and choose appropriate metrics based on the problem context</li> </ul>"},{"location":"chapter14/#intuitive-introduction","title":"Intuitive Introduction","text":"<p>Imagine you're building a spam email classifier.

This is where the algorithm learns patterns from the training data. For unsupervised models, <code>y</code> is omitted.</li> <li><code>predict(X)</code>: Generates predictions for new data <code>X</code>. For classifiers, it returns class labels; for regressors, continuous values.</li> <li><code>transform(X)</code>: Applies a transformation to <code>X</code>, such as scaling features or reducing dimensions. Used by preprocessors and some unsupervised algorithms.</li> <li><code>score(X, y)</code>: Evaluates the model's performance on data <code>X</code> and <code>y</code>, returning a metric like accuracy or R\u00b2.</li> </ul> <p>These methods ensure that once you learn one estimator, you can use them all similarly.</p> <p>Pipelines and cross-validation Pipelines chain multiple steps (e.g., preprocessing + model) into a single estimator, preventing data leakage and ensuring reproducibility.</p> <p>Cross-validation splits data into folds for robust evaluation, helping detect overfitting.

Instead of relying on a single weather expert, you consult a panel of meteorologists, each with their own forecasting method.

By combining their predictions \u2013 perhaps through majority voting \u2013 you often get a more reliable forecast than any single expert could provide.</p> <p>This is the essence of ensemble learning: combining multiple models to create a stronger, more robust predictor. Random Forests take this idea further by using bagging (bootstrap aggregating) to train decision trees on random subsets of data and features. Each tree is like an expert with a slightly different perspective, and their collective wisdom reduces the errors that plague individual trees, such as overfitting to noise or being overly sensitive to small data changes.</p> <p>Bagging works by creating multiple versions of the training set through bootstrapping \u2013 sampling with replacement \u2013 and training a separate model on each.
